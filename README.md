# bhuku-retsumo

## What is this?
This a short collection of shona proverbs, tsumo, that i am compiling into a short, and hopefully funny book, that i have aptly named bhuku-retsumo.  
I hope this becomes a bestseller one day and i finally afford to pay for web-hosting. Lol:laughing:.

## Inspiration
I find myself randomly quoting shona proverbs in my daily
life and a lot of people do too. My mum, my driving instructor, 
basically everyone anotaura tsumo here and there, but not everyone. 
I think the younger generations, myself included, may not know tsumo,
or think it valuable as much as the older generations like our parents
and grandparents. So i think it would be of great benefit for myself if
i compiled proverbs that i find useful in daily life and share with other 
people. 

## Whats the plan?
Right now i am still just compiling the proverbs
I want to have at least 100.
1. compile a list of useful and funny shonna proverbs
2. explain what they mean and add some personal touches to it
3. edit, edit, edit,
4. Share, share, share

## Where do you come in?
I have heard that language is a people 
and its preservation is a collaborative effort.
So feel free to make any edits, suggestions, additions or subtractions
at any level. just remember to be polite and respectful.
